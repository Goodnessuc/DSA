# Design Patterns and Principles
Design patterns are solutions to repetitive problems in software engineering. A design pattern is a template
for solving specific problems in software crafting. The templates are useful in several, different contexts. To be
able to use design patterns to solve problems, you must learn to identify the problems that are solvable with DPs, 
and the type of DP that solves the different problems. Nevertheless, you can directly design your software using
DPs.

## Categories of Design Patterns
Design patterns are roughly categorized into 3 areas:
1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavioral

## Design Principles
Design patterns are created using several design principles guidelines. The two key aspects in low-level
software design include:
1. Responsibility Assignment: What is the responsibility of each class?
2. Dependency Management: What other classes should this class depend on? What is the contract between these
two classes?

The principles that provide answers to these questions were made available by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob). They are 
referred to as SOLID principles:
- Single Responsibility


### Single Responsibility
Once class should have only one responsibility.
