# Data Structures and Algorithms 

## Why?
- knowledge of DSA is useful for building embedded systems in small apps that must run faster
- knowledge of DSA is useful for interviews when looking for a software engineering job
- knowledge of DSA makes you design efficient and better systems

## Learning Outcome
In a significant amount of days, I should have learned:
- data structures
- algorithms
- design patterns
- system design
- behavior
