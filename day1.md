# Learning Data Structures and Algorithms with Design Patterns

## Data Structures
A data structure is the organization of data in a computer's memory in a way that reduces storage space and difficulty of performing a task.
Data structures are useful for handling large amounts of data in different cases like database management and internet indexing services.
Data structures can be divided into different types:
1. linear
2. non linear
3. homogenous
4. heterogenous
5. dynamic

Owing to properties of the classifications above, there are differences in performance of different data structures. Thus, you will 
need to learn how to chooose the right data structures for a use case, as well as the structural design pattern.
When there is a problem to be solved with code, the first thing to do is to decide these three features; what data structure(s) are best used, what algorithms solves this easily and efficiently, what design pattern will make this easily structured? The next step is to do
a performance analysis of the solution code, in terms of the time and space consumed. Following these procedures will land you an optimal 
solution to the problem.

## Classification of Data Structures
### Heterogenous Data Structures
If the problem requires more than one data type, you will need to use a heterogenous data structure. They include:
- linked lists
- ordered lists
- unordered lists

### Linear Data Structures
Linear data structures are the popular ones. They include:
- lists
- sets
- tuples
- queues
- stacks
- heaps

### Non Linear Data Structures
Non linear data structures include the following:
- trees
- tables
- containers

### Homogenous Data Structures
These include:
- 2-dimensional and multidimensional arrays

### Dynamic Data Structures
These include:
- dictionaries
- tree sets
- sequences.
